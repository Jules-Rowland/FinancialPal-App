# FinancialPal-App
An app designed to help you organize and track your financial goals, manage your money, and monitor cash inflows and outflows.
This project is a simplified web application designed to help users manage their finances and track financial goals. The app caters to two distinct user types: salaried employees with predictable income and freelancers with variable income. By leveraging React and the browser's local storage, the app provides a fully functional front-end experience without the need for a complex back-end.
